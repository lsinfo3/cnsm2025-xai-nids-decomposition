For ICA-based, Inter-model, and Multiclass analyses plot names are in the format: "dataset_model_complexity_consensus_discrete.pdf", e.g, "CICIDS_MLP_binary_signed_ordered_False.pdf" means that the underlying dataset was CICIDS, model was MLP, binary classification, signed ordered consensus, and no discretization took place.

For the SPCA-based analysees format is similar with "dataset_model_complexity_consensus_horizontal_custom.pdf", i.e., the boolean in the end of the filename now shows if custom or sklearn's SPCA was applied. The added "horizontal" just implies that axes are switched.
